## SketchPad

An experimental redux of the DartPad UI.

## Status?

This is an unofficial re-imagining of the DartPad UI. Some goals:

- re-write in Flutter Web
- keep the UI simple; make sure it's visually interesting
- keep the number of use cases small; only Dart snippets and Flutter apps
  are supported

## How to run

To run this locally, run:

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

And to deploy, run:

```
flutter build web && firebase deploy
```
